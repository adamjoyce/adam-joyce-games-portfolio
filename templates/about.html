      <p>Hi my name is Adam!  I'm a Gameplay Programmer.</p>
      <p>I am currently looking for full-time and part-time gameplay programming
      opportunities based in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>I studied on the MSc Computer Games and Entertainment course at
      Goldsmiths University.  The course gave me a great foundation in game
      development covering many techniques integral to the games industry.</p>
      <p>I have developed a number of small game and tool projects during my
      time at university and in my spare time as a hobby.  Some of these
      projects can be found on the
      <a class="underline" href="{% url 'index' %}">projects</a> page.</p>
